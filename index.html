firstly i am not able tp puch my local repo to remote repo on github because of 
i use another account in my vs code and on the other hand i use another account on github
so i have to change the account in my vs code to the same account which i use on github.
<br>
so for that i have to follow these steps:
<br>
1. open the terminal in vs code
<br>
2. type the command: git credential-manager erase
<br>
  then enter prompted
<br>
protocol=https
<br>
host=github.com
<br>
then i push again my local repo to remote repo on github
<br>
And successfully i am able to push my local repo to remote repo on github.
<br>
